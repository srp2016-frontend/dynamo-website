#Install dependencies
If you're using a Windows machine, open `Git Bash`. Mac and Linux users should just use a terminal.

Navigate to your project directory using `cd`.

Once there, run `npm install tsc`. 
Wait for the install process to complete. 
(**NOTE:** Installing npm is outside of the scope of these instructions.) 
Then `build.sh` to build your script files. Make sure you do this after every change to a `.ts` file.
