##Currently Achievable
- Custom icons for the first responders
- Use configurable identifiers
- Multi-person selection
    - Search with non-match should select all possible matches
    - Shift + click should work on right infobar
- Search by non-name metadata
- Allow the user to select an application area

##Dependent on Other Teams
